That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity."

When he and his dog (really the last meaningful thing he has left) fall victim to a scummy group of Russian mobsters, he emerges from his shell with vengeance on his mind. Slow and ambiguous at first, but reveals more as it goes along, and once it kicks into gear it rarely lets up with plenty of stylized, visceral action scenes, an impressive arsenal of weaponry, plus sly direction and editing that give it the feel of a violent music video at times. Preposterously fun to watch, it just doesn't have much of a story at its disposal, not to mention all the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem eventually becomes redundant. Savvy, indestructible Reeves looks right at home, and delivers many of his lines with a sardonic wit. **\u00c2\u00bd"

It is a very fun, straightforward action movie with an 80's sensibility. It's nice to see Keanu doing these types of roles again. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Keanu Reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film. Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys! I personally think this film is better then all Taken films combined. It was simply brilliant, it was made for 20 million dollars and I am glad it made 40 million in the US. I think this film deserved to make 100 million!"

        "summary": "At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well."

The two directors have never made a film before and almost exclusively worked in the stunt department so far. The writer is not exactly experienced either. Lead actor Keanu Reeves usually scores more through boyish charm than through realistic portrayal of gritty badass characters. And the genre of crime action thrillers rarely delivers in terms of real significance. Still it became a very good film. The main reason for that is probably that it does not attempt to be anything of great cinematic value, does not try to teach groundbreaking stories on moral, loyalty or betrayal. Instead, Derek Kolstad's script goes for a gutsy revenge thriller that is not even hurt by its occasional predictability."

It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough.

And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don't care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action.

I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum (\"prepare for war\") sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can't seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it)."

Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless."

The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame."

Answer, not possible, only in this movie and series. How many times could the dog man have killed Wick? Many. So no other assassin could? Why would the table head get Caine to kill Wick when he knows he won't. You can challenge the head to a duel as a rule, but they only assigned a head for the first time ever in this movie? WTF? And then the head can select a replacement? And he selects a blind man. All Wick had to do was to stand on the side or drop down and he wouldn't get shot. I think everyone knew Wick didn't shoot in the last round, except for the stupid head bad guy. This is not an action movie, it's a fantasy."

The screenplay was so pretentious and pointless, the dialog looked forced and boring, katana swords vs. Bullets, and almost every bullet could be fenced off by the katana sword blades. The scenarios and the plots just kept stacked up without any reason or clue, just kill, kill, kill...nothing but kills. All the fighting sequences just like Shaw Brothers' 1970s poor and laughable Hong Kong martial art movies, heavily choreographically staged, looked so forced and fake. Every kill was not killed with one bullets but many, yet the handguns seemed equipped with endless bullets, bang, bang, bang, even the fallen guys already dead, but still needed to be shot several times more to increase the violent sound effect. I don't know what's the purpose of making these 4th Chapter, and I think the 1st Chapter only needed a following 2nd Chapter to end it, but what the heck, brainless young viewers need bloody fights, more dead bodies, ridiculous screenplay with clueless storyline, no real plots or real story really needed, just created something like violent video games."

It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. Yeah."

Anyway, I was looking forward to this film since John Wick 3's release back in 2019 & this film has had a bit of a troubled history of getting pushed back until it finally got its March 2023 release. I must admit I was a bit skeptical, but, was looking forward to this as the John Wick films are ace, but this film was a bitter disappointment...!"

Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet."

As has been the tradition in the sequels to this beloved martial arts action franchise the action starts from the very inception of the film's opening, and lasts until the curtain falls. JW4 is no exception to that rule. What it does do is improve on the prior installment, and solidify Keanu Reeves as the greatest martial arts action star of all time. If you don't accept that notion, then you must accept the fact that it solidifies Reeves and Director, Chad Stahelski, as the greatest martial arts action pairing of modern times."

He walks away from every major injury or collision or building fall. Then he passes away from flesh wounds. What nonsense. The whole plot is nonsense. The fights scene are so boring. I got up to make a sandwich twice. Just the typical 100 judo throws and same shots to head. Numerous coup de grace's. I feel sorry for anyone who paid for this nonsense."

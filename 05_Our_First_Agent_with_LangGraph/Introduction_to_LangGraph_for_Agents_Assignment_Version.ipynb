QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-05\\nTitle: Resource-Efficient & Effective Code Summarization\\nAuthors: Saima Afrin, Joseph Call, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Oscar Chaparro, Antonio Mastropaolo\\nSummary: Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated high effectiveness in\\nautomating software engineering tasks such as bug fixing, code generation, and\\ncode documentation.

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and accuracy of generated text. Here's how it generally works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: The system first retrieves relevant information or documents from a large corpus or database. This step is crucial for providing context and factual grounding to the generative model.\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved information is then used to augment the input to a generative model. This can involve incorporating the retrieved data directly into the input or using it to inform the generation process in some way.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model, uses the augmented input to produce a response or generate text. The goal is to create more accurate, contextually relevant, and informative outputs.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in applications like question answering, where the system needs to provide precise and factually correct answers by leveraging external knowledge sources.\""

However, the high computational and memory\\nrequirements of LLMs are a major bottleneck. To address this,\\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank adaptation\\n(LoRA) have been proposed to reduce computational costs while ensuring minimal\\nloss in performance. Additionally, knowledge distillation (KD) has been a\\npopular choice for obtaining compact student models from teacher models. In\\nthis work, we present KD-LoRA, a novel fine-tuning method that combines LoRA\\nwith KD. Our results demonstrate that KD-LoRA achieves performance comparable\\nto full fine-tuning (FFT) and LoRA while significantly reducing resource\\nrequirements. Specifically, KD-LoRA retains 98% of LoRA's performance on the\\nGLUE benchmark, while being 40% more compact. Additionally, KD-LoRA reduces GPU\\nmemory usage by 30% compared to LoRA, while decreasing inference time by 30%\\ncompared to both FFT and LoRA. We evaluate KD-LoRA across three encoder-only\\nmodels: BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3. Code is available at\\nhttps://github.com/rambodazimi/KD-LoRA.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-04-07\\nTitle: A Note on LoRA\\nAuthors: Vlad Fomenko, Han Yu, Jongho Lee, Stanley Hsieh, Weizhu Chen\\nSummary: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) has emerged as a preferred method for efficiently\\nadapting Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable simplicity and efficacy.\\nThis note extends the original LoRA paper by offering new perspectives that\\nwere not initially discussed and presents a series of insights for deploying\\nLoRA at scale. Without introducing new experiments, we aim to improve the\\nunderstanding and application of LoRA.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-18\\nTitle: LoRA-drop: Efficient LoRA Parameter Pruning based on Output Evaluation\\nAuthors: Hongyun Zhou, Xiangyu Lu, Wang Xu, Conghui Zhu, Tiejun Zhao, Muyun Yang\\nSummary: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is currently the most commonly used\\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, it introduces auxiliary\\nparameters for each layer to fine-tune the pre-trained model under limited\\ncomputing resources. However, it still faces resource consumption challenges\\nduring training when scaling up to larger models. Most previous studies have\\ntackled this issue by using pruning techniques, which involve removing LoRA\\nparameters deemed unimportant. Nonetheless, these efforts only analyze LoRA\\nparameter features to evaluate their importance, such as parameter count, size,\\nand gradient. In fact, the output of LoRA (product of LoRA parameter and hidden\\nstate), directly impacts the final results. Preliminary experiments indicate\\nthat a fraction of LoRA elements possesses significantly high output values,\\nsubstantially influencing the layer output. Motivated by the observation, we\\npropose LoRA-drop. Concretely, LoRA-drop evaluates the importance of LoRA based\\non the LoRA output. Then we retain LoRA for important layers and the other\\nlayers share the same LoRA. We conduct abundant experiments with models of\\ndifferent scales on NLU and NLG tasks. Results demonstrate that LoRA-drop can\\nachieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning and LoRA, while retaining\\n50\\\\% of the LoRA parameters on average.\", name='arxiv', id='629ddba1-807b-4ac2-a83d-ac7f9b0862dd', tool_call_id='call_1ADw2ieFDnaP3N8NinBoSlx1'), ToolMessage(content=\"Exception('Error 401: Unauthorized')\", name='tavily_search_results_json', id='ae0784b3-ad28-46b5-9094-bdd97d21797f', tool_call_id='call_s6XmN6OLtwYh1sBOhrXAgJqy', artifact={}), ToolMessage(content='Published: 2022-03-27\\nTitle: A General Survey on Attention Mechanisms in Deep Learning\\nAuthors: Gianni Brauwers, Flavius Frasincar\\nSummary: Attention is an important mechanism that can be employed for a variety of\\ndeep learning models across many different domains and tasks. This survey\\nprovides an overview of the most important attention mechanisms proposed in the\\nliterature. The various attention mechanisms are explained by means of a\\nframework consisting of a general attention model, uniform notation, and a\\ncomprehensive taxonomy of attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the various\\nmeasures for evaluating attention models are reviewed, and methods to\\ncharacterize the structure of attention models based on the proposed framework\\nare discussed. Last, future work in the field of attention models is\\nconsidered.\\n\\nPublished: 2022-07-04\\nTitle: Attention mechanisms for physiological signal deep learning: which attention should we take?\\nAuthors: Seong-A Park, Hyung-Chul Lee, Chul-Woo Jung, Hyun-Lim Yang\\nSummary: Attention mechanisms are widely used to dramatically improve deep learning\\nmodel performance in various fields. However, their general ability to improve\\nthe performance of physiological signal deep learning model is immature. In\\nthis study, we experimentally analyze four attention mechanisms (e.g.,\\nsqueeze-and-excitation, non-local, convolutional block attention module, and\\nmulti-head self-attention) and three convolutional neural network (CNN)\\narchitectures (e.g., VGG, ResNet, and Inception) for two representative\\nphysiological signal prediction tasks: the classification for predicting\\nhypotension and the regression for predicting cardiac output (CO). We evaluated\\nmultiple combinations for performance and convergence of physiological signal\\ndeep learning model. Accordingly, the CNN models with the spatial attention\\nmechanism showed the best performance in the classification problem, whereas\\nthe channel attention mechanism achieved the lowest error in the regression\\nproblem. Moreover, the performance and convergence of the CNN models with\\nattention mechanisms were better than stand-alone self-attention models in both\\nproblems. Hence, we verified that convolutional operation and attention\\nmechanisms are complementary and provide faster convergence time, despite the\\nstand-alone self-attention models requiring fewer parameters.\\n\\nPublished: 2018-10-17\\nTitle: An Analysis of Attention Mechanisms: The Case of Word Sense Disambiguation in Neural Machine Translation\\nAuthors: Gongbo Tang, Rico Sennrich, Joakim Nivre\\nSummary: Recent work has shown that the encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in neural\\nmachine translation (NMT) are different from the word alignment in statistical\\nmachine translation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing encoder-decoder\\nattention mechanisms, in the case of word sense disambiguation (WSD) in NMT\\nmodels. We hypothesize that attention mechanisms pay more attention to context\\ntokens when translating ambiguous words. We explore the attention distribution\\npatterns when translating ambiguous nouns. Counter-intuitively, we find that\\nattention mechanisms are likely to distribute more attention to the ambiguous\\nnoun itself rather than context tokens, in comparison to other nouns. We\\nconclude that attention mechanism is not the main mechanism used by NMT models\\nto incorporate contextual information for WSD. The experimental results suggest\\nthat NMT models learn to encode contextual information necessary for WSD in the\\nencoder hidden states. For the attention mechanism in Transformer models, we\\nreveal that the first few layers gradually learn to \"align\" source and target\\ntokens and the last few layers learn to extract features from the related but\\nunaligned context tokens.', name='arxiv', id='0fc4ba0f-683c-4ed1-a866-8c8a53a369f3', tool_call_id='call_BdaxptoDYOmc2NEmoxOBCYZy')]\n",

It is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that introduces auxiliary parameters for each layer to fine-tune pre-trained models. LoRA aims to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance. Recent advancements like KD-LoRA combine LoRA with knowledge distillation to further reduce resource requirements, achieving performance comparable to full fine-tuning while being more compact and efficient.\\n\\n### Tim Dettmers\\n\\nUnfortunately, I couldn't retrieve specific information about Tim Dettmers at this moment.
